Hackers are using a new technique to steal Google account passwords by using malware called StealC, which locks the user's browser in kiosk mode and blocks the F11 and ESC keys. The malware displays a login window for the user's Google account, forcing the user to enter their credentials, which are then stolen by the malware. Researchers have identified another ongoing credential-stealing threat, TrickMo, which pretends to be the Google Chrome web browser app for Android and uses an HTML overlay attack to capture account credentials. To mitigate these attacks, users are recommended to try hotkey combos to exit kiosk mode, avoid downloading Android software from unofficial sources, and keep their systems updated with the latest security patches. Additionally, a Microsoft Windows zero-day vulnerability has been identified, which is being exploited by the Void Banshee advanced persistent threat group to steal passwords, and users are advised to update their systems to patch this vulnerability.b:T41f,Here is a summary of the article in 5 sentences:

In contrast, FEDEX shares are anticipated to enter a buy cycle in early October, driven by improving relative strength and a historically strong Q4 rally. The monthly histogram for FEDEX shows that September has been a launching pad for a strong Q4 rally 73% of the time over the last 44 years. It is recommended to defer purchasing FEDEX shares until early October and hold them until the end of the year."}],["$","a",null,{"href":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/09/16/airline-stocks-poised-for-a-strong-second-half-in-2024/","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","className":"underline","children":"Original Source"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"rounded-lg border bg-card text-card-foreground shadow-sm","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-col p-4","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-2xl font-semibold leading-none tracking-tight","children":"Users of 'throuples' dating app Feeld may have had intimate photos accessed, experts say"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-sm text-muted-foreground flex flex-col gap-2 items-start mt-3","children":[["$","p",null,{"children":"September 17 2024"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"inline-flex items-center rounded-full border px-2.5 py-0.5 text-xs font-semibold transition-colors focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-ring focus:ring-offset-2 border-transparent bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80","children":"Field Issues"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"p-4 pt-0","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"mb-2","children":"According to a new report from Bank of America, airline stocks may be ready to take off again due to four key tailwinds: steady TSA throughput despite lower capacity, decelerating domestic capacity, lower fuel prices, and seasonal outperformance in the fall.

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has reported strong flight demand, with over 2.5 million people cleared to fly every day, exceeding pre-pandemic figures. Airlines are also cutting back on domestic capacity, which could drive up fares and revenue. Additionally, the industry is positioning itself for long-term success by investing in workforce expansion, fleet renewal, and IT upgrades, while paying down debt."}],["$","a",null,{"href":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/sep/17/dating-app-feeld-personal-data-cybersecurity","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","className":"underline","children":"Original Source"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"rounded-lg border bg-card text-card-foreground shadow-sm","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-col p-4","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-2xl font-semibold leading-none tracking-tight","children":"Netcrawl Turns The Internet Into A Dungeon"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-sm text-muted-foreground flex flex-col gap-2 items-start mt-3","children":[["$","p",null,{"children":"September 16 2024"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"inline-flex items-center rounded-full border px-2.5 py-0.5 text-xs font-semibold transition-colors focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-ring focus:ring-offset-2 border-transparent bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80","children":"Field Issues"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"p-4 pt-0","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"mb-2","children":"Netcrawl is a new tabletop role-playing game (RPG) that combines elements of science fiction and cyberpunk with the rules of Dungeon Crawl Classics (DCC RPG).
